# MP3Tracker
An MP3 playlist and song tracker created as a project for my CSCI-1260 course (Intro to Computer Science II). Users input their playlist and song data into the tracker, which saves the data to a delimited text file that can be 'loaded up' when reopening the tracker. The tracker also has multiple features related to sorting and displaying the data.
